Health initiative reaches schools

Prime Minister Hun Sen has appointed Minister of Education, Youth and Sport Hang Chuon Naron as the new chairman 
of an inter-ministerial committee for school health services.

In a cabinet meeting on April 5, 2019, the government finalised the draft law for the National Policy on School 
Health, intended to improve the quality of health-related education and ensure the good health and well-being of 
students and academic staff.

According to a directive signed by Hun Sen on December 4 last year and obtained by The Post on January 7, the 
committee comprises provincial governors and 23 secretaries of the state and the capital.

The directive established an incremental strategy to implement cooperative activities between learning institutions 
and health service providers in order to promote health education, sanitation and disease prevention, as well as 
provide essential healthcare services and clean water in schools.
